# Car-Rental-Platform

A reservation is a record of a car reservation by the user.
Contains information about the user, the car, the start and end dates of the reservation.
The price of the reservation is calculated based on how many days the reservation is and the cost of booking the car per day.
Days should be considered as a difference in dates.



There must be an opportunity to:
- creating a reservation, 
- making a reservation by ID,
- making reservations for a particular user,
- making reservations for a particular car, 
- Making a reservation for a certain period (here you will have to use @Query, whether native or not you decide).
- delete reservation by id.
- change of the car in the reservation
- Cancellation of the dates of the reservation
